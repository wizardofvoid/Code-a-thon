# Code-a-thon
Team ReCodex

This is a project wich is being developed by a team of 2nd year students studying in Vellore Institute of Technology for a Code-a-Thon being organised by Caterpillar corporation. 

The basic idea for this website is to help the enginners at caterpillar to better diagnose the machinary.
We were a team of 4 people:
  @ivanpadeliya
  @shlokGhadekar
  @Krishmehta
  @Ayushsaraf
This project is incomplete due to the time limitation. However this website got us to the final round of the hackathon where we had to think of new features to add so as to aid the engineers.
